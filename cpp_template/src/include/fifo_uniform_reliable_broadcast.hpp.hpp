/**
 * @brief FIFO-Order Uniform Reliable Broadcast (FRB)
 * 
 * @details Supports broadcasting a message to all processes in the system
 * and delivery of messages to all processes in the system satisfying FIFO-order
 * and uniform agreement.
 * - (FRB1: Validity) If a correct process p broadcasts a message m, then p
 *   eventually delivers m.
 * - (FRB2: No Duplication) No message is delivered more than once.
 * - (FRB3: No Creation) If a process delivers a message m with sender s, then 
 *   m must have been broadcast by s.
 * - (FRB4: Uniform Agreement) If m is delivered by some process (whether correct
 *   or faulty), then m is eventually delivered by every correct process.
 * - (FRB5: FIFO Order) If some process broadcasts message m before it
 *   broadcasts message n, then no correct process delivers n unless it has
 *   already delivered m.
