 * @brief Uniform Reliable Broadcast (URB) via Majority-Ack Algorithm
 * 
 * @details Supports broadcasting a message to all processes in the system
 * and delivery of messages to all processes in the system satisfying uniform
 * agreement.
 * - (URB1: Validity) If a correct process p broadcasts a message m, then p
 *   eventually delivers m.
 * - (URB2: No Duplication) No message is delivered more than once.
 * - (URB3: No Creation) If a process delivers a message m with sender s, then 
 *   m must have been broadcast by s.
 * - (URB4: Uniform Agreement) If m is delivered by some process (whether correct
 *   or faulty), then m is eventually delivered by every correct process.
